It has been my honor to attend several performances - something few outsiders are permitted. There is a recurring theme of a war: a collision between the shadows and a \"bright and fierce light\" that resulted in centuries of turmoil, and bears a striking resemblance to Rasmodia's tales of the Elemental Wars.^Alas, my time amongst their kind was cut abruptly short, after an unfortunate misunderstanding... - I shall spare you the details, my friend! - But needless to say, a hasty retreat was in order!^^Yours, M. Jasper.",
