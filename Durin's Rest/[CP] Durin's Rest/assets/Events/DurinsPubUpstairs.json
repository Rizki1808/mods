I never had the knack for farming the way he did... Someone who can grow juniper like he did deserves this!$h#$b#I think someone with as green a thumb as you could really make full use of an underground greenhouse.#$b#Come meet me downstairs and I'll unearth the greenhouse for ya to use!$h\"/pause 1000/animate Durin 0 0 250 33 33 33 33 29 30 31/pause 2000/Move Durin 0 -1 0/addMailReceived DwarvenGreenhouseUnlocked/end position 4 15",
